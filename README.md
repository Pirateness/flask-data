# flask
Flask is a multi-user server manager that enables servers to be created, maintained and hosted with no individual owner.

Ownership of servers is shared between multiple users, and the hosting of the server is given to the individual who is determined to have the best possible connection and computing power for hosting the server. Server saves are automatically backed up to GitHub at regular intervals to mitigate data loss. The UI interface is built as an electron app using HTML, CSS and JS, while the backend is handled by Python and NodeJS.
